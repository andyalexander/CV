% OVERVIEW
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{introduction}

I am someone who is motivated by using technology and analytics to improve how decisions are made, and how value is created.  Most recently as a data science lead for a leading investment bank, and prior to that as the analytics technology and data science CIO for a leading commodities trading house.

Having crossed between commercial and technology roles I appreciate the motivation and tensions that can exist.  Throughout these roles I have remained a ‘hands on’ leader / practitioner - recognising the importance of being able to 'lead from the front', as well as develop and implement change through strategy.

I bring a unique blend of experience covering hands on analytic roles, through technology strategy, full stack development, IT architecture and CIO activities.  

I am equally happy leading a team of 8 or 80, having a track record successfully delivering commercial value with both; what is common is my ability to create commercially valuable solutions using a mixture of analytic frameworks and open source technologies.
