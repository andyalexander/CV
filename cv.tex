% OVERVIEW
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{introduction}

I am someone who is motivated by using technology and analytics / machine learning to improve how decisions are made, and how this drives value.  I have a strong background in applying this, most recently as a data science lead for a leading investment bank, and prior to that as the analytics technology and data science CIO for a leading commodities trading house.

Having crossed between commercial and technology roles I appreciate the motivation and tensions that inervitably exist.  Throughout these roles I have remained a ‘hands on’ leader / practitioner - recognising the importance of being able to 'lead from the front', as well as develop and implement longer term change.

I bring a unique blend of experience covering hands on analytic roles, through technology strategy, full stack development, IT architecture and CIO activities.  This means I can take the lead in a machine learning development project, work a set of strategic options with C level executives or lead a development team.
